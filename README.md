# About
This was my first attempt at making a game with JavaScript. I learned a lot during the process, but this also led to some messy code. Now that I have an understanding of the process of creating a game with JS, I plan to do a complete rewrite to make the code more readable and modular.

# How to Play
I'm sure many people have played this type of game before, but I'll explain the objective just in case. You have to push all of the crates onto the goal tiles. Once a crate is in the correct location, it will turn green. Once all of the crates are green, you will move to the next level.

# Controls

# Cheats
